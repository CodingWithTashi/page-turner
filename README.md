# PageTurner — Book Lovers' Discovery Portal

**Live Site:** https://bookpageturner.netlify.app/

---

## Project Pitch

PageTurner is a web portal for avid readers who want a calm, distraction-free place to discover books, find their next read by genre, get daily literary inspiration, and connect with a local book club community — without the noise and algorithm-driven clutter of platforms like Amazon or Goodreads.

## User Persona

**Target User:** Regular readers, ages 20–35

| Attribute      | Detail                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name           | Priya, 28 — graduate student and remote worker                                 |
| Reading habits | Reads 2–3 books per month, discovers books through word-of-mouth               |
| Tech comfort   | Moderate — uses apps daily, not a developer                                    |
| Goal           | Find well-curated book recommendations filtered by mood and genre              |
| Pain Point     | Amazon feels overwhelming; Goodreads is cluttered with ads and social pressure |

## Problem Statement

Book lovers spend more time searching for their next book than actually reading. Existing platforms are noisy, algorithm-driven, or socially exhausting. PageTurner solves this by offering a focused, curated portal with a handpicked book gallery filterable by genre, a daily quote pulled live from an external API, and an easy form to join a local book club community.

---

## Application Structure

PageTurner is built across three distinct HTML pages:

**Home (`index.html`)**
Hero section with a headline and call-to-action. Three hand-picked staff pick book cards. A live "Quote of the Day" widget that fetches a literary quote from the API Ninjas Quotes API on each page load, with a button to fetch a new quote without reloading the page.

**Library (`library.html`)**
Full book gallery of eight books rendered dynamically from a local JavaScript array. Real-time search input filters cards by title or author as the user types. Genre filter tabs (All, Fiction, Non-Fiction, Mystery, Sci-Fi, Biography) work simultaneously with the search input. An empty state message displays when no results match.

**Community (`community.html`)**
Book club information and meeting schedule. A join form with four fields — full name, email, preferred genre, and a message — validated entirely through custom JavaScript rules. Errors appear inline per field on blur and again on submit. On success, the form is replaced with a confirmation message.

## Technical Implementation

**Technologies**

- HTML5 with semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- CSS3 with custom properties (variables), Flexbox, CSS Grid, and mobile-first media queries
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) — no frameworks or third-party libraries
- Fetch API for asynchronous data retrieval
- No build tools required — runs directly in the browser

**API**

API Ninjas – Quotes API
`https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/quotes?category=happiness`

Each response includes: `quote`, `author`, and `category`. On network error, the widget falls back to a hardcoded quote so the page never breaks.

---

## Design System

All colors, spacing, and typography are defined as CSS custom properties in `style.css`:

- Primary font: Playfair Display (headings) paired with Source Serif 4 (body)
- Accent color: burnt orange (`#C2410C`) — warm, editorial, and distinct from typical web palettes
- Background: warm off-white (`#FAFAF7`) to avoid the sterile feel of pure white

---

## Responsive Design

The site is built mobile-first. The most complex responsive component is the genre filter on `library.html`, which renders as a horizontally scrollable pill bar on mobile and transforms into a full tab row on desktop — a drastic layout shift handled entirely through CSS Grid and media queries with no JavaScript involved.
